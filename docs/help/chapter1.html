<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>eformsign is an electronic document solution that allows anyone to
easily create electronic documents from paper documents and utilize
various data stored in electronic documents. You can easily create
electronic documents by uploading your PDF files onto eformsign and
converting the files to electronic forms via eformsign’s Web Form
Designer feature. You can also use eformsign’s Microsoft Office add-in
to create electronic forms from documents created using Microsoft Office
programs including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.</p>
<p>eformsign allows you to create a workflow for each template according to
your company’s business process. You can flexibly set a document signing
process for internal documents requiring approvals as well as for
external documents such as contracts, agreements, and applications.
Furthermore, detailed configurations such as notifications and required
input fields can be set for each workflow step or recipient, and the
progress status of documents is logged as history. Moreover, an audit
trail certificate is provided for the prevention of document forgery and
falsification.</p>
<p>eformsign also provides a bulk send feature, by which users can create
and send multiple documents at once and can minimize repetitive input
with the auto-fill feature. Also, by adding and configuring custom
fields, fields in documents such as company information, group and
member information, recent input value, and date can be automatically
filled in. Furthermore, eformsign allows users to easily manage
companies’ members and their permissions, configure detailed
notification settings for documents, and manage and utilize data
entered in documents by extracting input data.</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/main_feature.png"><img alt="Key Features" src="../_images/main_feature.png" style="width: 700px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>The eformsign solution also provides a digital signature feature which
allows you to sign e-signatures on electronic documents.</p>
<p>A digital signature is a signature in electronic form that replaces the
traditional wet-ink signature. Just as when signing a signature on
paper, you need to prove that the signer is you and this is done by
going through an identity verification step. Personal information such
as email, social security number, password, phone number, certificate,
etc. can be used to verify identity.</p>
<p>Digital signatures have become legally binding in phases in the vast
majority of countries around the world. eformsign’s e-signatures are
legally binding for individual-individual and corporation-individual
matters. As well, it provides various additional features for
non-repudiation.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The following describes the legal effect of digital signatures of
some regions.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>South Korea: Digital signatures based on PKI standards have a
strong legal status, and their legality is not discriminated
against the wet-ink signatures. According to Section 3.3 of the
Digital Signature Act, a digital signature other than a certified
digital signature shall have such an effect of a signature,
signature and seal, or name and seal, as is agreed between the
parties concerned.</p></li>
<li><p>USA: Under the “technologically neutral” principle, any preference
to more sophisticated or more secure technologies such as PKI is
not given. There are many cases of increasing the reliability of
digital signatures through identity verification or authentication
services.</p></li>
<li><p>EU: Digital signatures are categorized into Qualified Electronic
Signatures (QES), Advanced Electronic Signatures (AdES), and
general Electronic signatures, and their legal status is applied
accordingly, corresponding to the characteristics of each type of
document.</p></li>
<li><p>Japan: With the existence of a Specified Authentication Services,
a stronger legal effect is given to the digital signature
authorized by the secretary of the state.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="basic-terms">
<h2>Basic Terms<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-terms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following are some basic terms you should be familiar with before
using eformsign.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Web Form Designer</strong></p>
<p>Web form designer is a tool for quickly and easily
creating electronic forms by uploading existing document files onto
eformsign. You can create templates by adding components such as
signature, text box, and check box to documents such as agreements,
applications, and contracts in the PDF format. You can then create
documents from templates and send them to recipients to be reviewed
and signed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Form Builder</strong></p>
<p>Form builder is a tool used to create electronic forms
by converting Microsoft Office files such as applications, contracts,
and agreements into electronic forms that contain components such as
signature and text box. Form builder also uploads the converted
electronic forms onto eformsign. Form builder is an Microsoft Office
add-in, and it is shown as a ribbon menu which is called <strong>OZ in Office</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dashboard</strong></p>
<p>This is the main screen shown when logging into eformsign.
You can access the sidebar menu by clicking the menu icon(<img alt="image1" src="../_images/menu_icon.png" />)
on the left side of the screen. Each menu may appear differently
depending on the permissions you have. (The Company administrator can
access all the menus.)</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/dashboard.png"><img alt="eformsign Dashboard Screen" src="../_images/dashboard.png" style="width: 700px;" /></a>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Templates</strong></p>
<p>Templates This is an electronic form that serves as a starting point
for a new document. With a template, you can create many documents
from it. You can create templates by converting existing Microsoft
Office files using Form builder or by uploading PDF files directly
onto eformsign.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Document</strong></p>
<p>A document can be an electronic document you create and send
for signature by using a template or an electronic document you
create and send by upload your file. A document can be created and sent
for signature by using either one of the <strong>New from my file</strong> menu or
the <strong>New from template</strong> menu. Any document created like this counts
as a document created in eformsign.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is a cloud space for storing and viewing documents. It consists of the following three menus according to the
document status:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Action required:</strong> Shows the list of documents
that you need to sign, approve, or send.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>In progress:</strong> Shows the list of documents you have
created or processed but are incomplete.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Completed:</strong> Shows the list of all the completed
documents you have created or participated in.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Drafts</strong></p>
<p>Shows the list of documents saved as draft when creating a
document by accessing the <strong>New from my file</strong> menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Workflow</strong></p>
<p>A workflow refers to the entire document process from when a
document is created to when it is completed. Template managers can
create the workflow steps for each template. All workflows have two
default steps, <strong>Start – Complete</strong>, and can add
three more types of steps as shown below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Approver:</strong> Step in which an approver can approve the document sent by the document creator.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Internal recipient:</strong> Step in which an internal recipient (a member of the company) can review and sign the document sent by the document creator.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>External recipient:</strong> Step in which a user who is not a member of the company can review and sign the document sent by the document creator (or the internal recipient).</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="figure align-default">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/workflow_new.png"><img alt="Workflow Steps" src="../_images/workflow_new.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Company Administrator</strong></p>
<p>The representative of a company and has full permission to use eformsign.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Company Management Permission</strong></p>
<p>Members with company management permission can access company
management menus, and can manage the company, groups, and members.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Template Management Permission</strong></p>
<p>With this permission, a member can access the <strong>Manage templates</strong>
menu and can manage templates. Managing templates includes creating,
deploying, editing, and deleting the eformsign templates.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Document Management Permission</strong></p>
<p>With this permission, a member can access the <strong>Manage documents</strong>
menu to view the documents created from each template, approve
documents requested to be voided, or permanently remove documents
from the system. Note that the document management permission can be
set for each separate template.</p>
</li>
</ul>
