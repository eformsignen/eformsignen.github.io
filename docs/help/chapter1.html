<h1>Introduction to eformsign<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-eformsign" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>eformsign is an electronic document solution that allows anyone to easily create electronic documents from paper documents and utilize various data stored in electronic documents. You can easily create electronic documents by uploading your files onto eformsign and converting the files to electronic forms via eformsign’s Web Form Designer feature. You can also use eformsign’s Microsoft Office add-in to create electronic forms from documents created using Microsoft Office programs including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.</p>
<p>eformsign allows you to create a workflow for each template according to your company’s business process. You can flexibly set a document signing process for internal documents requiring approvals as well as for external documents such as contracts, agreements, and applications. Furthermore, detailed configurations such as notifications and required input fields can be set for each workflow step or recipient, and the progress status of documents is logged as history. Moreover, an audit trail certificate is provided for the prevention of document forgery and falsification.</p>
<p>eformsign also provides a bulk send feature, by which users can create and send multiple documents at once and can minimize repetitive input with the auto-fill feature. Also, by adding and configuring custom
fields, fields in documents such as company information, group and member information, recent input value, and date can be automatically filled in. Furthermore, eformsign allows users to easily manage
companies’ members and their permissions, configure detailed notification settings for documents, and manage and utilize data entered in documents by extracting input data.</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/main_feature.png"><img alt="Key Features" src="../_images/main_feature.png" style="width: 700px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>The eformsign solution also provides an electronic signature feature which
allows you to sign e-signatures on electronic documents.</p>
<p>An electronic signature is a signature in electronic form that replaces the
traditional wet-ink signature. Just as when signing a signature on
paper, you need to prove that the signer is you and this is done by
going through an identity verification step. Personal information such
as email, social security number, password, phone number, certificate,
etc. can be used to verify identity.</p>
<p>Electronic signatures have become legally binding in phases in the vast majority of countries around the world. eformsign’s e-signature is legally-binding for individual-to-individual and corporation-to-individual contracts. As well, it provides various additional features for non-repudiation.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The following describes the legal effect of electronic signatures signatures of
some regions.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>USA: Through the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) enacted in 1999 and the Electronic Signature in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN) enacted in 2000, electronic signatures that meet specific requirements are recognized to have the same legal effect as wet signatures. There are four main requirements that must be met in order for an electronic signature to be legally binding: the intention of signing (signer certification), the intention and consent, the record of the signing process, and the preservation of the signature. Currently, 48 states in the United States have adopted electronic signature acts, and as a result, electronic signatures are recognized as having the same legal effect as handwritten signatures in almost all transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>EU: In accordance with eIDAS (Electronic Identification and Trust Services) regulations, all types of electronic signatures are recognized as legally effective and binding. They are categorized into Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES), Advanced Electronic Signatures (AdES), and general Electronic signatures, and their legal status is applied accordingly, corresponding to the characteristics of each type of document.</p></li>
<li><p>Korea: According to the Digital Signature Act, the legality of an electronic document or signature is not denied because it is in an electronic format. As well, the monopolistic status of the certificate authority has been abolished and the same legal effect is given to a variety of commercial electronic signature services. In addition, the monopoly status of accredited certificates has been abolished and the same legal effect is given to a variety of private digital signature services.</p></li>
<li><p>Japan: The legal effect of electronic signatures is recognized in accordance with laws on electronic signature and certification services.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="basic-terms">
<h2>Basic Terms<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-terms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following are some basic terms you should be familiar with before
using eformsign.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Web Form Designer</strong></p>
<p>Web form designer is a tool for quickly and easily
creating electronic forms by uploading existing document files onto
eformsign. You can create templates by adding fields such as
signature, text box, and check box to documents such as agreements,
applications, and contracts. You can then create
documents from templates and send them to recipients to be reviewed
and signed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Form Builder (MS Office add-in)</strong></p>
<p>Form builder (MS Office add-in) is a tool used to create electronic forms
by converting Microsoft Office files such as applications, contracts,
and agreements into electronic forms that contain fields such as
signature and text box. Form builder (MS Office add-in) also uploads the converted
electronic forms onto eformsign. Form builder (MS Office add-in) is an Microsoft Office
add-in, and it is shown as a ribbon menu which is called <strong>OZ in Office</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dashboard</strong></p>
<p>This is the main screen shown when logging into eformsign.
You can access the sidebar menu by clicking the menu icon(<img alt="image1" src="../_images/menu_icon.png" />)
on the left side of the screen. Each menu may appear differently
depending on the permissions you have. (The Company administrator can
access all the menus.)</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/dashboard.png"><img alt="eformsign Dashboard Screen" src="../_images/dashboard.png" style="width: 700px;" /></a>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Templates</strong></p>
<p>Templates This is an electronic form that serves as a starting point
for a new document. With a template, you can create many documents
from it. You can create templates by converting existing Microsoft
Office files using Form builder (MS Office add-in)or by uploading files directly
onto eformsign.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Document</strong></p>
<p>A document can be an electronic document you create and send
for a signature by using a template or an electronic document you
create and send by uploading your file. A document can be created and sent
for a signature by using either one of the <strong>New from my file</strong> menu or
the <strong>New from template</strong> menu. Any document created like this counts
as a document created in eformsign.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Documents</strong></p>
<p>This is a cloud space for storing and viewing documents. It consists of the following menus according to the document status:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Action required:</strong> Shows the list of documents
that you need to sign, approve, or send.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>In progress:</strong> Shows the list of documents you have
created or processed but are incomplete.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Completed:</strong> Shows the list of all the completed
documents you have created or participated in.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bulk send:</strong> Shows the list of all the document you have sent in bulk.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Drafts</strong></p>
<p>Shows the list of documents saved as draft when creating a
document by accessing the <strong>New from my file</strong> menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Workflow</strong></p>
<p>A workflow refers to the entire document process from when a
document is created to when it is completed. Template managers can
create the workflow steps for each template. All workflows have two
default steps, <strong>Start – Complete</strong>, and can add
three more types of steps as shown below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Participant:</strong> The step for requesting a person to fill out and sign a document.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reviewer:</strong> The step for requesting a person to review a document. A reviewer cannot fill in fields and can only approve or reject documents.</p></li>
</ul>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/en_workflow_new.png"><img alt="Workflow Steps" src="../_images/en_workflow_new.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Company Administrator</strong></p>
<p>The representative of a company with full permission to use eformsign.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Company manager</strong></p>
<p>Members with company management permission can access company
management menus, and can manage the company, groups, and members.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Template manager</strong></p>

deploying, editing, and deleting eformsign templates.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Document manager</strong></p>
<p>With this permission, a member can open, download, void, and remove documents created from the templates the member has access to. Note that the document management permission can be
set for each template.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Template user</strong></p>
<p>With this permission, a member can create documents from a template. You can grant this permission for each template. When the permission for a template is granted to a member, the member can create documents from that template in the New from template page.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Template editor</strong></p>
<p>With this permission, a member who is a template editor of a template can edit the template. You can grant this permission for each template.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Create from template<a class="headerlink" href="#create-from-template" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are two ways to create a document from a template: uploading a
file on eformsign and creating a template using Web Form Designer, and
creating a template using Microsoft Office using Form Builder (MS Office add-in) and
uploading it on eformsign.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Using Web Form Designer</strong></p>
<p>You can create a template by uploading a document
file (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or image files) on eformsign and then adding the participants who can fill in the document and adding fields to the uploaded document in the <strong>Design form</strong> step. Then, configure settings including General, Set permissions, Workflow, Field, and Notification settings in the <strong>Configure step</strong>. Then, you can save and deploy the template for use. Finally, you can go to <strong>New from template</strong>, select a template you want to create a document from, and then send the document to recipients.</p>
