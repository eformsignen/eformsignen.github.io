About Templates
------------------

Templates are **electronic documents** used for the eformsign service. They are e-documents transformed from existing paper forms such as applications, contracts, and agreements. You can create and upload templates in the eformsign service with its **Web form designer** or **eformsign for Microsoft Office**. 



.. tip::

  **❗Why use templates?**

   Using templates is useful for documents that need to be sent often or regularly. If a tempate is registered once, you don't have to upload a document file whenever you need to send a document. You can just easily create and sent documents using the template. 


.. note::

   For more information about eformsign for Microsoft Office, refer to `Creating templates using eformsign for Microsoft Office <chapter7.html#template_fb>`__.



**How to create a template with Web Form Designer**

**Configure basic settings for the template**
-------------------------------------------------------


Set basic information about the template including the template name, category, validity period, etc.

**① Template name**
   The template name will be displayed in the **Manage templates** and **New from template** pages.

   The recommended length of the template name is about 11 characters, including spaces. If the name is longer than 11 characters, you can see the full name by hovering the mouse over the name.


**② Template abbreviation**
   A short name that briefly descries the template. It is recommended to use two or three words.

   **Template abbreviation** can be used in the document number, document name, mail template, etc.


**③ Category**
   Category is used to sort templates by type. With the category name, you can filter templates in the **Manage templates** menu, and can filter documents in the **Documents** menus and the **Manage documents** menu. You can choose from an existing category or create a new category by entering a new name.

   You can set multi-level categories with a separator ( **/** ). For example, if you set a category as **HR Team/Vacation**, the Vacation category in the HR category is created.

**④ Description**
   Enter additional comments about the template. This description is displayed under the template name in **New from template.**

**⑤ Template availability**
   Sets the time period in which documents can be created from this template. By default, the start date is set to the uploaded date and you can change the date.

   If you check **No expiry date**, documents can be created without a time limit. If you uncheck it and set the date, then documents can be created from the template up to that date.



**Document settings**
-------------------------------------

Configure additional settings including document naming rules for documents created from the template.

**⑥ Document naming rule**
   Sets the document name when creating the document from the template. If a document naming rule is not set, the template name will be the document name.

**⑦ Allow document name change**
   If **Allow document name change** is checked, the document creator can change the document name.

**⑧ Generate a document number**
   If **Generate a document number** is checked, documents are automatically numbered. You can select the document number format and the workflow step in which document numbers are generated.

   |image3|

**⑨ Skip pop-up window when sending documents**
   Use it when many documents are created and submitted. If this option is unchecked, a pop-up window for entering a message will appear when sending a document. When **Skip pop-up window when sending documents** is checked, the pop-up window does not appear and the page proceeds to the next step.

**➉ Document retention period**
   Sets the retention period for documents created from the template. If this is not set, then the document retention period for the template follows the company-wide settings.

   .. note::

      The retention period can be set from a minimum of 1 day to a maximum of 15 years.

      **Maximum retention period by year/month/day**
      
      - 15 years
      - 180 months
      - 5,475 days

      💡For information on how to set the company-wide document retention period, go to `Document retention period <chapter2.html#retention>`_.



.. _document_naming:

General > Setting the Document Naming Rule
----------------------------------------------------

In **Template settings**, you can set the document naming rule for documents created from a template.

**Document naming rule**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can make a piece of information entered into a document or document-related information to be automatically entered into the document name. If you set the document naming rule, then the document name is automatically entered based on the information of the document. As well, you can see this name in all document pages (In progress, Action required and Completed) and the **Manage document** page.

**Start: Step for creating a document**

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


   .. figure:: resources/start_step_en.png
      :alt: Start step

   -  **Limit the number of documents**: Set the maximum number of documents that can be created from the template.

   -  **Create documents from URL**: Create a public link for external recipients (non-members) to review and sign documents directly via URL without the need to login to the eformsign service.

   -  **Document creator information**: Require users to enter their information (name, email, etc.) before they open documents created from URL.

   -  **Do not allow duplicate documents**: Prevent the creation of duplicate documents and allows to select a field for determining whether a document is duplicated or not.

   -  **Identity verification**: Require document creators to verify their identity before opening documents created from URL.

      - **Require email/SMS verification:** Send a 6-digit verification code to the recipient's email or mobile phone number. The recipient can enter the verification code into the verification window to open the document.


   .. tip::

   If both the Document creator information and Identity verification options are enabled in a template's workflow, then when document creators create a document from this template, they need to enter their information and verify their identity to create documents. Note that the document creator’s information and identify verification will be displayed in document inboxes and on the audit trail certificate.

   - **Approved domain IP**: Set to allow creating documents only form approved domains or IPs.

   -  **Block automated document generation by bots**: Require users to tick the reCAPTCHA check box before submitting documents to prevent bots from auto-generating documents.

   .. note::

      **Block automated document generation by bots**

      By selecting this option, when a person submits a document after creating a document via URL, the reCAPTCHA feature is dispalyed on the Submit document pop-up. The person can submit the document after ticking the "I'm not a robot" check box. 

      .. figure:: resources/URL-option-recaptcha.png
         :alt: reCAPTCHA
         :width: 250px

      ❗Disabling this option allows bots to mass-generate documents from the document URL, resulting in excessive charges.


.. tip::

   **How to generate QR code when using the 'Create documents from URL' option**

   When creating a signing link by using the 'Create document form URL' option, you can generate a QR code instead of a signing link.  You can upload the QR code image on a website or share it with others so the people can create and submit documents by scanning the image using the camera on a mobile device.

   Select the **Create documents from URL** option in the Start step of the workflow and click the
   **Generate QR code** button to download the image file.

            .. figure:: resources/en-doc-require-doc-password-setting.png
               :alt: Require document password
               :width: 400px    
      
   - **Require email/SMS verification**\: Require recipients to verify their identity using email/SMS. A 6-digit code will be sent to recipients' email address/mobile number and the recipients must enter the code in the identity verification window. Note that a charge of 0.1 USD incurs per SMS verification.
      
-  **Disable the decline feature:** Blocks recipients from being able to decline documents.

-  **Hide files or sheets:** Allows you to choose which files/sheets in the document are hidden from the recipient, if the form consists of two or more files. This option cannot be applied to company members.


.. note::

**How to collaborate with other recipients in a workflow step**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. tip::

   
   If you add multiple recipients in a workflow step, all recipients of the step can sign or review the document.

   .. figure:: resources/collaborate_workflow.png
      :alt: All recipients can sign or review the document
      :width: 500px

   However, multiple recipients cannot work on a document simultaneously. Only one recipient can work on a document at a time, and all others are locked out from the document and can only preview it.

   .. figure:: resources/document_locked.png
      :alt: Document locked
      :width: 500px


   Once the recipient working on the document saves it as a draft by clicking the see more button (⋮) and then clicking **Save as draft**, then other recipients can work on the document.

   .. figure:: resources/save_as_draft_collaborate.png
      :alt: Save as draft
      :width: 200px
   

   ❗Note that when there are multiple recipients in a workflow step, if any one of them submits a document, it is sent to the next step in the workflow. Therefore, when you finish working on a document, you should save it as as a draft and only send the document when everyone has finished working on it.


**How to hide files in a document**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. tip::

   
   **Using the 'Hide files or sheets option'**

   If you add multiple files to a document, you can hide certain files from recipients in a workflow step. If you upload multiple files to a document, then the **Hide files or sheets** option appears in the **Properties** tab of workflow steps in **Template settings** where you can choose to hide or show each file.
   

   ❗Note that the 'Hide files or sheets' option is only available when sending a document to non-member recipients.

   **Instructions**

   1. Go to **Sidebar menu  Manage templates**.
   2. Click the **Settings icon (⚙)**\ of the desired template.
   3. Go to **Configure > Workflow**.
   4. Select the desired **recipient** step. 
   5. Select the **Hide files or sheets** option in **Properties** on the right. 
   6. For each file or Excel sheet, select one of the options below.

      - **Required:** The file or sheet is shown to the recipient.

      - **Optional:** The document creator can choose whether to show or hide the file or sheet to the recipient.

      - **Hide:** The file or sheet is hidden from the recipient.

You can set the default value of a field to be the value saved in company/group/member information in **Manage custom fields**. You can also choose it to be the value entered recently or a value entered manually.

.. tip::

   **How to configure auto-fill**

   You can save information that are frequently entered into a document so that they can be used for auto-filling later.

   For example, you can pre-save information about your company or group (such as department name, leader, and representative number) and information about the document creator (including name and contact details). You can add items for related fields and set the default values in **Manage company > Manage custom fields**.

   1. In the **Manage custom fields** screen, add a field.

   2. Go to the **Manage templates** menu.

   3. Click the **Template settings** icon.

   :alt: Notification settings


.. note::

   When the **Document creator** option is checked but the **Step handler** option is unchecked, a status notification is sent to the person who originally created the document.

   When the **Document creator** option is unchecked but the **Step handler** option is checked, status notifications are sent to people who have processed the document before the current step, except the document creator.

   When the **Document creator** and **Step handler** options are both checked, status notifications are sent to both the document creator and the people who have processed the document before the current step.

   When the **Document creator** and **Step handler** options are both unchecked, no notifications will be sent for that status.



.. caution::

      ❗When the **Document creator** option for **When the document is completed** is checked and an external recipient creates and submits a document via a URL, the external recipient must enter his/her email in which a notification will be sent to when the document is completed.

   |image28|


-  **Restore previous version**: This is a rollback feature that makes it easy to revert a published template to a previous version. If the most recently saved template version is higher than the published version, you can restore it to the previous version. Once restored, any versions higher than the restored version is deleted.

   **Example**

   - Published version: v.2
   - A saved version that has not yet been published: v.3
   - If you roll back, v.3 is deleted, and the template is restored to v.2.

   ❗ **Rollback Conditions**

   - The most recently saved version must be v.2 or later.
   - The most recently published version must be lower than the current saved version.
   - Rollback is only available when the template is in the Need to publish status.
   - Rollback permissions: Template owner, members with template edit permission, adminstrator, and the most recent publisher.

When you successfully roll back, all editable values on the template settings page name, version, status, category, template publisher, etc.) revert to the previous version’s values. However, items not connected to the template version remain in their most recent status.


**How to Roll Back a Template Version**
