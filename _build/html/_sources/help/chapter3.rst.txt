Creating documents
====================



Anyone can use eformsign to easily convert existing documents into electronic documents and then send them for signature. In eformsign, there are two ways to create and send documents. You can upload a file from your PC to eformsign, or use an existing template saved in eformsign.

-  **New from my file**: You can upload your file to create an electronic document and then send it to signers.

-  **New from template**: You can use a template uploaded to eformsign to create documents. When you click this menu, templates created by the company administrator or members with template management permissions are displayed on the screen.

.. note::

   Templates can be created only by the company administrator or members with the template management permission, and the templates on the screen are shown only to members who are given template usage permission for a given template.

   You can create a template using Web Form Designer or Form Builder (MS Office add-in).
   For more information, refer to `Web Form Designer <chapter6.html#template_wd>`__ and
   `Form builder <chapter7.html#template_fb>`__.

.. tip::

   When creating a document with **New from my file**, you cannot save it as a template. For documents you plan on using frequently, it is recommended to create a template first.

New from my file
-------------------

You can upload a file you want and then add fields onto the document. Then, you can specify the signers that will fill in each field and enter the information of the document signers and reviewers, and then send the document.

1. Go to the **New from my file** menu.

   .. figure:: resources/en-new-from-my-file-dashboard.png
      :alt: New from my file in the dashboard
      :width: 700px


2. Upload the document file you want. The supported file types are pdf, hwp, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, odt, jpg, png, gif, and tiff with a maximum size of 9MB.

   |image2|


3. Add the **document signers** that will be participating in document creation and select their roles.

   .. figure:: resources/en-signers-popup.png
      :alt: Signers pop-up
      :width: 300px

   .. note::

      You can add signers by clicking **Add new signer** and up to 30 can be added. Note that you can change, add, or delete signer information in the **Add recipient** step after the **Design form** step.

4. Add the fields each signer will fill in and then set the field properties on the right.

   .. figure:: resources/en-new-from-my-file-design-form.png
      :alt: Design form in New from my file
      :width: 700px

5. In the Add recipients step, you can add contact information such as email and phone number and set **Recipient options** for each signer.

   .. figure:: resources/new-en-add-recipients-enter-contact-info.png
      :alt: New from my file > Enter contact info
      :width: 700px

   .. note::

      **'Signer and Reviewer' recipients**

      There are 2 main recipient types: reviewer and signer. The
      signers added in the Design form step are shown in the Add
      recipients step. You can enter the contact information of each
      recipient such as email. In the Add recipient screen, you can
      delete/add signers and reviewers and set detailed options for
      each recipient.

      .. figure:: resources/2_recipients.png
            :alt: Reviewer and Signer
            :width: 300px


   .. tip::

      **The difference between signers and reviewers**

      Signers can fill in fields such as signature and text on
      each document, but reviewers cannot fill in fields and can
      only approve documents after reviewing them.


   .. note::

      **'Need to view' recipient**

      In addition to reviewer and signer, there is also another recipient type called 'Need to view'.

      You can select 'Need to view' when selecting recipients in the workflow. A recipient who is assigned as 'Need to view' can' send a document to the next step in the workflow by only viewing the document.

      .. figure:: resources/need_to_view.png
            :alt: Need to view
            :width: 300px

      ‚ùóNote that a recipient assigned the Need to view type cannot fill out a document, and cannot approve/reject a document.




6. Click the **Options** step to change the document title and select whether to timestamp the document when completed.

   |image7|

   .. note::

      The above three steps are the steps you need to go through before
      creating a document. If you save the document before
      clicking the **Start now** button, the document is saved in
      `My saved documents <chapter8.html#my-saved-documents>`__, and the saved file can be opened again so
      that you can begin creating a document. To save a document, click the **Save** button at the top right corner of the screen.

      |image9|

7. When you are done with all the settings, click **Start now**.

   |image10|

   .. caution::

      A document is created once you click **Start now**, and it counts
      as a created document.

8. If you click the **Send** button after reviewing/filling in the document, then the document is sent to recipients.

   |image11|
   

**Add recipients > Recipient options**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the **Design form** step or the **Add recipients** step, you can add signers who will receive the document.

In the **Add recipients** step, you can set detailed settings for each signer. Additionally, you can add or remove signers as well as adding reviewers who will review the document.

You have to add the name of each signer and reviewer, and their email/ID. If a signer is a member of your company, you can select the member in the drop-down menu and import their member information stored in eformsign.

The detail settings in **Recipient options** is displayed differently depending on whether the signer or reviewer is a member of your company or is a non-member.

.. note::

   In addition to signers and reviewers, you can also add CCs. CCed recipients can monitor the document progress and will receive a notification email when the document is sent and completed. Only members can be set as CCs. 


.. note::

   In order for a recipient to be recognized as a member, the **name** and **email/ID** must match.


-  **When the recipient is a member:**

   .. figure:: resources/whenrecipientismember.png
      :alt: When the recipient is a member
      :width: 700px

   -  **Select document delivery method:** You can select whether to send the document via email or mobile. The email address and mobile number are automatically filled-in if a member is selected.

      .. note::

         When the mobile number option is selected, then the document will be sent via SMS and additional charges will occur.


   -  **Notification:** **Edit notification message** Allows to edit the email or SMS notification message sent to recipients.      

   -  **Document expiration:** Allows to set the period in which recipients can open and submit documents.

      .. tip::

         Setting the valid period to 0 days 0 hours disables the document expiration period.


   -  **Disable the decline feature:** Allows to block recipients from declining documents. If you select this option, the **Decline** feature will not appear on the recipients' screen.

.. tip::

   üí° **Using the In-person signing feature**
    
   The In-person signing feature allows you to collect signatures in person from signers using a single device, whether it‚Äôs a PC, tablet, or smartphone. By using this feature, even when you collect signatures from signers in person, the signers‚Äô information is recorded in document history and audit trail certificate, and completed documents are automatically sent to the signers.

   To get started, select **In-person signing** in the recipient step where you want to use the feature.
   This recipient of this step becomes the **In-person signer** and the recipient of the step before it becomes **Host**. You can configure the settings so that an In-person signer needs to verify their identity before opening the document.

   - **Host:** The Host can start and complete In-person signing sessions. If the Host is a signer recipient, then the Host can sign as well. Note that only members can be in-person signers and Need to view recipients cannot be the Host. 
   - **In-person signer:** In-person signers can sign and only signer recipients can be in-person signers.

   .. figure:: resources/inperson-signing-wf.png

   ‚úÖ For instructions on how to use the In-person signing feature, refer to the following `blog <https://www.eformsign.com/en/blog/whats-new-in-eformsign-nov-2023/>`_. 



-  **When the recipient is a non-member:**

   If the information you enter is not the same as the member information, then the recipient is recognized as a non-member. This requires the below information to be filled in.

   -  **Notification > Email/SMS:** You can select one of **Email and SMS**, or both. If you select **SMS**, then you must enter the mobile phone number of the recipient.

      .. caution::

         If you select **SMS**, then the document is sent via SMS and additional charges will apply per SMS.


   -  **Notification:** You can edit the outgoing email or SMS notification message when documents are sent by clicking the **Edit notification message** button.

   -  **Document expiration:** You can set the expiration period in which the non-member can open and submit the document. The document cannot be opened once the date expires.For non-members, the document expiration can be set up to 50 days. 

   -  **Identity verification:** You can make recipients to verify their identity before opening documents. You can set a two-step verification by selecting both **Require document password** and **Require email/SMS verification**. 

      -  **Require document password** : Allows to set a password that requires non-member recipients to enter before opening documents. You can also enter a password hint for the recipient.

         - There are three types of passwords you can set: **Create password, Recipient name, Field value**. 

            - Create password: The recipient must enter the password you set here in order to open the document.

            - Recipient name: The recipient must enter the name that the sender entered in the Send document pop-up window in order to open the document. 
   
            - Field value: You can select a field and the value entered in that field becomes the password.

               .. figure:: resources/en-doc-password-setting.png
                  :alt: Password settings for opening documents
                  :width: 400px     

      -  **Require email/SMS verification**\ : The recipient must enter the 6 digit PIN code sent to their email address or phone number to opent the document. Choosing this option along with the **Require document password** option will make it a two-step identity verification.

         - **Require identity verification when opening completed documents:** Checking this option requires the recipient to also verify their identity when opening the completed document.

            .. figure:: resources/en-additional-verification.png
               :alt: Additional verification
               :width: 400px  

         .. note::

            Additional charges will be applied if the 6 digit PIN code is sent via SMS.

   -  **Disable the decline feature:** Blocks recipients from being able to decline documents.

   :alt: Send in bulk screen
   :width: 800px

.. tip::

   **How to enter data when sending documents in bulk**

   **Method 1. Enter manually: max 200 documents (rows)**

   Select **Enter manually** to display the table in which you can enter data directly. Each column of the table contains all the fields of a document. The IDs of fields (which are fields in a template) are shown as the name of each column. The last row of the first column (No.) indicates the number of documents to be created..

   Tables are filled in a similar way as in Excel. You can double-click on each cell to enter a value and right-click on the mouse to add or delete columns. The value entered in a cell can be copied and pasted, and dragged to another cell.

   When entering data by uploading an Excel file, you must first download the Excel file for data entry shown on the screen, then enter data into the fields in the file, and then finally upload the file.

   .. figure:: resources/bulksend-edit.png
      :alt: Send in bulk enter manually option 
      :width: 700px

   **Method 2. Upload file: max 1000 documents (rows)**

   Select **Upload file**\ and download the Excel file for data entry. Once the file is downloaded, enter the neccessary data into the file and upload it.

      .. figure:: resources/en-schedule-send-in-bulk.png
         :alt: Schedule send in bulk
         :width: 400px


6. Go to the **Bulk send** inbox in the sidebar to view the details of bulk sent documents.


.. tip::

   Right before sending documents in bulk, eformsign will automatically check to see if there are any errors in the document. Documents with an error will not be sent and only normal documents will be sent.

   .. figure:: resources/en-bulksend-data-validation.png
      :alt: Data validation
      :width: 400px


.. tip::

   If there is a field that is not shown in the **Send in bulk** screen, then the following must be checked.

   1. The fields that cannot be entered in **Send in bulk**: camera, voice, and grouped radio fields cannot be used in Send in bulk.

   2. Check whether the fields are allowed access in Template settings. Only the fields that are checked to be allowed access in **Manage templates > Template settings (‚öô) > Workflow settings**
   are shown.

   You can delete rows by right-clicking on your mouse and selecting the desired option in the pop-up window.
